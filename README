Inspired by Emmanuel Touzery tip:
" http://vim.sourceforge.net/tip_view.php?tip_id=332 
" and discussion below (thanks to Luc for pluginization hints) 
" I added functions and turned it into vim script.


" Commands:
" <Leader>f (in insert mode) - inserts footnotemark, opens at bottom window where
"     footnotemark is also inserted and you are ready to type in your
"     footnotetext.
" <Leader>r (in insert mode) - closes footnote window and returns to the text in
"     proper place. 
"
" You can change them by placing in your vimrc:
"  imap your_map <Plug>AddVimFootnote
"  imap your_map <Plug>ReturnFromFootnote
"
"
"    Footnotes are placed at the end of the file but above signature delimiter
"    (is one exists). 
"
" Settings:
" g:vimfootnotetype - possible values:
" 	arabic (default) - [1] [2] [3] ...
" 	alpha  - [a] [b] ... [z] [aa] [bb] ... [zz] [a] ...
"   Alpha  - as above but uppercase [A] ...
"   star   - [*] [**] [***] ...	
"
" Additional commands:
" FootnoteNumber:
" 	You can change current footnote number (one obligatory argument)
"   :FootnoteNumber 5	
" FootnoteNumberRestore:
"	You can restore old footnote number  
"	:FootnoteNumberRestore	
" FootnoteUndo: 
"	Decrease footnote counter by 1
"	:FootnoteUndo	 
" FootnoteMeta:
" 	Change type of the footnotes and restart counter (1, a, A, *)
" 	:FootnoteMeta
" 		If your previous footnote type was alpha, Alpha or star new type will
" 		be arabic.
" 		If your previous footnote type was arabic new type will be alpha.
" 	:FootnoteMeta name_of_the_type
" 		Change footnote type to name_of_the_type. If name_of_the_type is the
" 		same as	your current footnote type nothing would be changed.
" FootnoteRestore:
" 	Restore previous footnote type and counter. Unfortunately there is no easy
" 	way to sort footnotes at the end of file without handmade :!sort on marked
" 	lines (it doesn't work for 'star' type).
" 	:FootnoteRestore	
"
" For easier work with this commands I would suggest place this lines in your
" vimrc (they offer very nice competion of Vim commands):	
"	set laststatus=2
"	set wildmode=longest,list
"	set wildmenu
"
" And/or map :FootnoteComs for something you like.
